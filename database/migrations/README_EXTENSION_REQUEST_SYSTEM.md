# Extension Request System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This system provides a seamless workflow for tutors to request deadline extensions when they encounter sessions blocked by Valid If constraints, and for admins to review and approve these requests with full context and automated execution.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: Tutor tries to reschedule â†’ Valid If blocks â†’ Tutor emails admin â†’ Manual back-and-forth â†’ Admin manually extends enrollment â†’ Tutor tries again

**After**: Tutor tries to reschedule â†’ Valid If blocks â†’ Tutor clicks "Request Extension" â†’ Admin reviews with context â†’ One-click approval extends enrollment + reschedules session

## Complete Solution Components

### 1. Database Layer (Migration 020)
- **`extension_requests`** table - stores all requests with audit trail
- **`pending_extension_requests_admin`** view - rich context for admin decisions
- **`extension_requests_tutor`** view - tutor's request history

### 2. Integration Layer (Works with Migration 019)
- Uses `calculate_effective_end_date()` for accurate date calculations
- Integrates with `enrollment_effective_dates` view for Valid If constraints
- Maintains holiday-aware extension logic

### 3. Application Layer (AppSheet Configuration)
- **Tutor Action**: "Request Extension" on session_log
- **Admin Views**: Rich dashboard with context and guidance
- **Admin Actions**: One-click approve (extend + reschedule) or reject
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of requests and decisions

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Triggering**
- Action only appears when session is beyond enrollment effective end date
- Prevents unnecessary requests for sessions within valid period

### ðŸ§  **Intelligent Admin Context**
- Shows pending makeups count (justifies extension need)
- Displays current extension status and limits
- Provides admin guidance flags (URGENT, REVIEW REQUIRED, STANDARD)
- Calculates projected effective end date with requested extension

### âš¡ **One-Click Approval**
- Single action extends enrollment + reschedules session + updates request
- Automatic audit trail in enrollment notes
- Immediate availability for Valid If validation

### ðŸ“Š **Complete Audit Trail**
- Who requested, when, why
- Admin decision with timestamp and notes
- Integration with enrollment extension history

## Business Workflow

### Phase 1: Tutor Discovery
```
Tutor reschedules session â†’ Valid If blocks â†’ "Request Extension" appears
```

### Phase 2: Request Submission
```
Tutor fills: Extension weeks + Reason + Proposed new date â†’ Submit
```

### Phase 3: Admin Review
```
Admin sees: Student context + Pending makeups + Extension history + Admin guidance
```

### Phase 4: Decision Execution
```
Admin approves â†’ Enrollment extended + Session rescheduled + Request marked approved
```

### Phase 5: Immediate Resolution
```
Tutor can now reschedule session â†’ Valid If allows new date
```

## AppSheet Configuration Summary

### Tutor Side
- **Action**: "Request Extension" (on sessions beyond enrollment period)
- **View**: "My Extension Requests" (track request status and history)

### Admin Side
- **View**: "Extension Requests Management" (rich context dashboard)
- **Actions**:
  - "Approve Extension Request" (extend + reschedule)
  - "Reject Extension Request" (with admin notes)
  - "Grant Extension Only" (extend without reschedule)

### System Integration
- **Data Sources**: 3 new tables/views added
- **Virtual Columns**: 7 calculated fields for rich context
- **Workflows**: Complete request â†’ review â†’ approval â†’ execution cycle

## Business Rules Enforced

### Request Eligibility
âœ… Session must be for paid enrollment
âœ… Session date must be beyond current effective end date
âœ… Session must be owned by requesting tutor
âœ… Session must be scheduled/makeup status

### Admin Guidelines
- **Standard** (0-2 weeks, has pending makeups): Auto-approve recommended
- **Review** (3-4 weeks OR no pending makeups): Admin discretion
- **Special** (5+ weeks OR already 4+ extended): Management approval
- **Urgent** (7+ days pending): Priority handling required

### Extension Limits
- System tracks cumulative extensions per enrollment
- Admin guidance adjusts based on current extension level
- Business can set policies around maximum total extensions

## Integration Benefits

### With Valid If System
- Seamless: Extension approved â†’ Valid If immediately allows new date
- No cache refresh or delays required
- Uses same holiday-aware calculation logic

### With Existing Extension System
- Consistent with manual admin extension grants
- Same audit trail and tracking mechanisms
- Maintains all existing business rules

### With Class Request System
- Follows same approval pattern for consistency
- Admins familiar with similar workflow
- Same notification and audit patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests (Database)
- Table and view structure validation
- Foreign key and constraint verification
- Integration with existing functions confirmed

### Manual Tests (AppSheet)
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Edge case handling (rejections, limits, duplicates)
- Performance under load
- User experience validation

### Business Tests
- Admin guidance accuracy
- Extension limit enforcement
- Audit trail completeness
- Integration with enrollment renewal workflow

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Database Setup âœ…
- [x] Execute migration 020
- [x] Run test suite validation
- [x] Verify integration with migration 019

### Phase 2: AppSheet Configuration
- [ ] Add data sources to AppSheet
- [ ] Configure virtual columns
- [ ] Set up tutor "Request Extension" action
- [ ] Create admin management views
- [ ] Configure approval/rejection actions

### Phase 3: Testing & Training
- [ ] Test complete workflow with sample data
- [ ] Train admin team on new approval process
- [ ] Train tutors on request submission

## Summary

This extension request system transforms a manual, error-prone process into a seamless, automated workflow that benefits tutors, admins, and the business overall. By integrating with the existing Valid If and extension systems, it provides immediate value while maintaining data integrity and business rule compliance.

**The result**: Tutors can focus on teaching instead of administrative bottlenecks, admins can make informed decisions quickly, and the system maintains reliable constraint enforcement while providing necessary flexibility.

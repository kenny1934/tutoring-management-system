3. **Recovery** (30+ minutes):
   - Deploy previous stable version
   - Investigate root cause
   - Plan fix for next deployment

### Data Issues
1. **Stop sync immediately** to prevent corruption spread
2. **Identify affected records** using audit trail
3. **Restore from backup** if necessary
4. **Verify data integrity** before resuming service
5. **Communicate issue** and resolution to users

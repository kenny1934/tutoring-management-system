# Solving Our Curriculum Documentation Challenge
## An Intelligent Solution for Better Tutoring Outcomes

**Math Concept Secondary Academy**  
*Executive Presentation - September 2025*

---

# The Problem We Face

<div class="problem-box">

### Current State
- 📊 **Curriculum tracking**: Separate Google Sheets (often forgotten)
- ⏰ **Recording rate**: ~30% completion due to high friction
- 🤔 **Daily impact**: Tutors lack context when preparing lessons
- 📚 **Result**: Misalignment with school curriculum progress

</div>

### The Hidden Cost
**9 tutors** spend **30 minutes each** searching for curriculum information weekly
- **4.5 hours/week** of inefficiency
- **$225/week** in lost productivity
- **$11,700/year** in hidden costs

*AI Image Prompt: A frustrated tutor at a desk with multiple open spreadsheets on a laptop screen, looking confused while holding teaching materials, with sticky notes scattered around showing different school names like "PCMS F2C", "SRL-C F1E", realistic office photo style, soft lighting*

# Current vs. Ideal Workflow

## Before (Current State)
1. ❌ Finish teaching session
2. ❌ Try to remember curriculum details (usually fail)
3. ❌ Open separate spreadsheet later
4. ❌ Find correct school/grade tab
5. ❌ Type topic (if remembered at all)

## After (With Our Solution)
1. ✅ Mark attendance in CSM Pro
2. ✅ See last year's curriculum automatically
3. ✅ Tap "Confirm" if same topic (3 seconds)
4. ✅ Done!

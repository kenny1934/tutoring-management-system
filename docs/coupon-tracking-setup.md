# Student Coupon Tracking & Auto-Discount System

## Overview

This system automatically applies discount coupons during enrollment renewal by:
1. Syncing coupon data from your company system (source of truth)
2. Matching students by their company ID (e.g., MSA1395)
3. Auto-filling $300 discount when renewing if coupon available
4. Company system tracks usage (we only sync the current state)

---

## How It Works

### Data Flow

```
Company System (Excel) â†’ Process Script â†’ SQL Updates â†’ Sync to Database â†’ Auto-Apply on Renewal â†’ Mark Used in Company System â†’ Next Sync Shows Updated Count
```

### Key Components

1. **student_coupons table**: Syncs current coupon count from company system
2. **coupon_file_uploads table**: Tracks file uploads and sync history
3. **students_with_coupons view**: Easy lookup of who has coupons
4. **Renewal action**: Auto-applies "Student Discount $300" if coupon available
5. **Company system**: Source of truth for coupon counts and usage tracking

---

## Setup (One-Time)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```sql
-- Run migration 026
SOURCE database/migrations/026_add_student_coupon_tracking.sql;
```

### Step 2: Sync AppSheet

1. Go to AppSheet â†’ **Data** â†’ **Tables**
2. Click **Regenerate Structure**
3. Verify new tables appear:
   - `student_coupons`
   - `coupon_file_uploads`
   - `students_with_coupons` (view)

### Step 3: Configure Coupon Upload Table

**Table: coupon_file_uploads**

**Add these columns in AppSheet:**

1. **file_path** (File type)
   - **Type:** File
   - **Show:** YES
   - **Editable:** YES
   - **Initial Value:** (blank)

2. **uploaded_by** (Text)
   - **Type:** Text
   - **Initial Value:** `USEREMAIL()`
   - **Editable:** NO

3. **upload_date** (DateTime)
   - **Type:** DateTime
   - **Initial Value:** `NOW()`
   - **Editable:** NO

4. **process_status** (Enum)
   - **Type:** Enum
   - **Values:** Pending, Completed, Failed
   - **Initial Value:** "Pending"
   - **Editable:** NO

### Step 4: Create Upload View

1. **UX** â†’ **Views** â†’ **New View**
2. **Name:** Upload Coupons
3. **For table:** coupon_file_uploads
4. **View type:** form
5. **Position:** Primary

This creates a simple upload form.

---

## Regular Use: Uploading Coupon Data

### Method 1: CSV Upload (Recommended - Simpler)

#### Step 1: Convert Excel to CSV

1. Open `TerminationList_MSA_XXXX.xls` in Excel
2. **File** â†’ **Save As**
3. Choose **CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)**
4. Save as `coupons.csv`

#### Step 2: Upload via AppSheet

Since AppSheet doesn't parse CSV automatically, we'll use **Google Sheets as intermediate step**.

**Alternative: Manual Update (Fastest for Small Changes)**

If only a few students have coupons, manually update:

1. Go to **student_coupons** table in AppSheet
2. Find the student
3. Update **available_coupons** field
4. Save

### Method 2: Google Sheets Import (Recommended - Automated)

#### Setup (One-Time):

1. Create new Google Sheet: "Coupon Data Import"
2. Share with your AppSheet account
3. Add as data source in AppSheet

#### Regular Use:

1. Open Excel file `TerminationList_MSA_XXXX.xls`
2. Copy columns A and K (ID and Coupon)
3. Paste into Google Sheet
4. Run AppSheet bot to process (see Bot Setup below)

---

## AppSheet Bot: Auto-Process Coupon Data

### Create Bot: "Process Coupon Data"

**Event:** Data Change
**Table:** Google Sheet (coupon import)
**Change Type:** Adds only OR Updates

**Process:**

**Step 1: Update Student Coupons**

For each row in import sheet:

1. Parse company ID (e.g., "MSA1395")
   - Extract location: "MSA"
   - Extract ID: "1395"

2. Find matching student:
   ```
   SELECT * FROM students
   WHERE home_location = 'MSA' AND school_student_id = '1395'
   ```

3. Update or insert into student_coupons:
   ```
   INSERT INTO student_coupons (student_id, available_coupons, coupon_value)
   VALUES (student_id, coupon_count, 300.00)
   ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
   available_coupons = coupon_count,
   last_updated_at = NOW()
   ```

**AppSheet Expression:**

```
LOOKUP(
  CONCATENATE([home_location], [school_student_id]),
  "students_with_coupons",
  "company_id",
  "student_id"
)
```

---

## Simpler Approach: Manual CSV Processing Script

Since AppSheet's parsing is complex, here's a **Python script** to process the file:

### Create: `scripts/process_coupons.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Process coupon Excel file and generate SQL updates
"""

import pandas as pd
import sys
from datetime import datetime

def process_coupon_file(excel_path):
    """
    Read Excel file and generate SQL INSERT statements
    """
    # Read Excel (column A and K)
    df = pd.read_excel(excel_path, usecols=[0, 10])  # A=0, K=10
    df.columns = ['company_id', 'coupons']

    sql_statements = []

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        company_id = str(row['company_id']).strip()
        coupons = row['coupons']

        # Skip header or invalid rows
        if company_id == 'ID#' or pd.isna(company_id):
            continue

        # Parse location and student ID
        # e.g., "MSA1395" -> location="MSA", id="1395"
        if len(company_id) < 4:
            continue

        # Find where numbers start
        for i, char in enumerate(company_id):
            if char.isdigit():
                location = company_id[:i]
                student_id = company_id[i:]
                break
        else:
            continue  # No numbers found

        # Parse coupon count
        if coupons == '--' or pd.isna(coupons):
            coupon_count = 0
        else:
            try:
                coupon_count = int(coupons)
            except:
                coupon_count = 0

        # Generate SQL
        sql = f"""
INSERT INTO student_coupons (student_id, available_coupons, coupon_value, last_synced_by, sync_source_file)
SELECT
    id,
    {coupon_count},
    300.00,
    'system',
    '{excel_path}'
FROM students
WHERE home_location = '{location}' AND school_student_id = '{student_id}'
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
    available_coupons = {coupon_count},
    last_synced_at = NOW(),
    last_synced_by = 'system',
    sync_source_file = '{excel_path}';
"""
        sql_statements.append(sql.strip())

    return sql_statements

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python3 process_coupons.py <path_to_excel_file>")
        sys.exit(1)

    excel_file = sys.argv[1]
    print(f"Processing: {excel_file}\n")

    sql_list = process_coupon_file(excel_file)

    # Write to file
    output_file = f"coupon_updates_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.sql"
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write("-- Generated coupon updates\n")
        f.write(f"-- Source: {excel_file}\n")
        f.write(f"-- Generated: {datetime.now()}\n\n")
        f.write('\n'.join(sql_list))

    print(f"âœ… Generated {len(sql_list)} SQL statements")
    print(f"ðŸ“„ Output: {output_file}")
    print(f"\nTo apply: mysql -u your_user -p your_database < {output_file}")
```

### Usage:

```bash
# Install pandas if needed
pip3 install pandas openpyxl

# Run script
python3 scripts/process_coupons.py "TerminationList_MSA_2025-11-01_20251004054509.xls"

# Apply generated SQL
mysql -u root -p csm_pro < coupon_updates_20251004_120000.sql
```

This generates SQL that you can review and run.

## Enrollment Renewal: Auto-Apply Discount

### Modify Renewal Action

**Update your renewal action workflow:**

#### Step 1: Check for Available Coupons

**Before creating new enrollment, check:**

```
LOOKUP(
  [student_id],
  "student_coupons",
  "student_id",
  "available_coupons"
) > 0
```

#### Step 2: Set Discount Automatically

**If coupon available:**

1. Find $300 discount in discounts table:
   ```
   SELECT id FROM discounts
   WHERE discount_name = 'Student Discount $300'
   AND is_active = TRUE
   ```

2. Set discount_id for new enrollment:
   ```
   discount_id = LOOKUP(
     "Student Discount $300",
     "discounts",
     "discount_name",
     "id"
   )
   ```

#### Step 3: Mark Usage in Company System

**After successful renewal:**

- Mark the coupon as used in your company system
- Next time you sync the coupon file, the updated count will be reflected
- No need to decrement in CSM Pro - company system is the source of truth

### AppSheet Action: Complete Renewal with Coupon

**Action Name:** Renew with Auto-Discount

**Steps:**

1. **Check coupon availability**
   - Expression: `[student_id].[available_coupons] > 0`
   - Store in variable: `has_coupon`

2. **Create new enrollment** (Data: add a new row to another table)
   - Table: enrollments
   - Set values:
     - student_id: `[student_id]`
     - tutor_id: `[tutor_id]`
     - assigned_day: `[assigned_day]`
     - assigned_time: `[assigned_time]`
     - location: `[location]`
     - lessons_paid: (user input)
     - payment_date: `TODAY()`
     - first_lesson_date: (user input)
     - payment_status: "Paid"
     - **discount_id:**
       ```
       IF(
         [_has_coupon],
         LOOKUP("Student Discount $300", "discounts", "discount_name", "id"),
         ""
       )
       ```
     - renewed_from_enrollment_id: `[id]`

3. **Mark old enrollment as completed**
   - Set payment_status = "Completed"

**Note:** After renewal, mark the coupon as used in your company system. The next coupon file sync will show the updated count.

---

## Verify $300 Discount Exists

### Check Discounts Table

The system uses the existing "Student Discount $300" discount (id=1). Verify it exists:

```sql
SELECT * FROM discounts WHERE discount_name = 'Student Discount $300';
-- Should show: id=1, discount_type='Fixed', discount_value=300.00, is_active=TRUE
```

---

## User Experience

### Scenario: Renewal with Coupon Available

1. Admin opens enrollment needing renewal
2. Clicks **Renew** action
3. AppSheet checks: Student has 2 coupons available
4. Form pre-fills:
   - Discount: "Student Discount $300" âœ… (auto-selected)
   - All other fields copied from old enrollment
5. Admin confirms renewal
6. New enrollment created with $300 discount
7. Admin marks coupon used in company system
8. Next sync: Coupon count 2 â†’ 1
9. Admin sees confirmation: "Renewal complete! Coupon applied"

### Scenario: Renewal without Coupon

1. Same process
2. Student has 0 coupons
3. Discount field: Blank or manual selection
4. No coupon deduction

---

## Reporting & Monitoring

### View: Active Coupons

```sql
SELECT
    s.student_name,
    s.school_student_id,
    s.home_location,
    sc.available_coupons,
    sc.last_updated_at
FROM students s
JOIN student_coupons sc ON s.id = sc.student_id
WHERE sc.available_coupons > 0
ORDER BY sc.available_coupons DESC, s.student_name;
```

### View: Coupon Usage History

```sql
SELECT
    s.student_name,
    e.payment_date,
    d.discount_name,
    d.discount_value
FROM enrollments e
JOIN students s ON e.student_id = s.id
JOIN discounts d ON e.discount_id = d.id
WHERE d.discount_name LIKE '%Coupon%'
ORDER BY e.payment_date DESC;
```

### Dashboard Metrics

**AppSheet Dashboard:**

1. **Total Active Coupons**
   ```
   SUM(students_with_coupons[available_coupons])
   ```

2. **Students with Coupons**
   ```
   COUNT(SELECT(students_with_coupons[student_id], [has_coupon_available] = "Yes"))
   ```

3. **Last Coupon Data Update**
   ```
   MAX(student_coupons[last_updated_at])
   ```

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

**Weekly: Upload Coupon Data**
1. Download latest TerminationList from company system
2. Run processing script OR manual upload
3. Verify update count

**Monthly: Audit Coupon Usage**
1. Compare coupon redemptions vs. company system
2. Identify discrepancies
3. Adjust as needed

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: Student has coupon in file but not in database**

Check:
1. âœ… home_location and school_student_id match exactly
2. âœ… Student exists in students table
3. âœ… Processing script ran successfully

**Problem: Discount not auto-applying**

Check:
1. âœ… Discount "Student Discount $300" exists and is_active = TRUE
2. âœ… Renewal action includes coupon check logic
3. âœ… student_coupons.available_coupons > 0

**Problem: Coupon count not updating after renewal**

Remember:
1. âœ… Company system is the source of truth
2. âœ… Mark coupon used in company system after renewal
3. âœ… Next coupon file sync will show updated count
4. âœ… We don't decrement locally in CSM Pro

---

## Recommended Workflow

**Best Practice: Semi-Automated**

1. **Weekly**: Download Excel from company system
2. **Process**: Run Python script locally to generate SQL
3. **Review**: Check generated SQL for accuracy
4. **Apply**: Run SQL updates in database
5. **Verify**: Check AppSheet dashboard for updated counts

This gives you:
- âœ… Full control and visibility
- âœ… Audit trail (saved SQL files)
- âœ… Quick updates (< 5 minutes)
- âœ… Error checking before applying

---

## Alternative: Fully Manual (If File Parse Too Complex)

If automation is too complex for now:

1. **Create spreadsheet view** of student_coupons table
2. **Export** current coupons to Excel
3. **Manually update** coupon counts in Excel
4. **Import back** to AppSheet

Takes 10-15 minutes vs. 2-3 minutes automated, but simpler setup.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Real-Time API Integration

If company system has API:
1. Connect directly to company database
2. Sync coupons automatically (daily cron job)
3. No manual file upload needed

### Phase 3: Coupon Expiration

Add:
```sql
ALTER TABLE student_coupons
ADD COLUMN coupon_expiry_date DATE NULL COMMENT 'When coupons expire';
```

Track expiring coupons and alert before renewal.

---

## Summary

**Current Setup:**
- Manual file upload (weekly/monthly)
- Python script processes and generates SQL
- Syncs coupon counts from company system
- Auto-applies "Student Discount $300" on renewal
- Company system tracks actual usage

**Time Investment:**
- Setup: 30 minutes
- Regular use: 5 minutes per upload

**Benefits:**
- âœ… No manual discount selection
- âœ… Prevents errors (applying when no coupon)
- âœ… Company system is source of truth
- âœ… Simple sync workflow
- âœ… Audit trail through file uploads

# Gemini CLI Session Notes

This file tracks the progress and objectives of our development sessions.

### **Session: 2025-07-26**

**Last Task Completed:**
- Implemented audit trails for the `session_log` table.
  - **Method:** Created a reusable AppSheet action named "Set Audit Columns (Session Log)" that sets `last_modified_by` and `last_modified_time`.
  - **Integration:** This reusable action was added to other actions like "Attended" and "Edit Notes".

**Current Task in Progress:**
- Implementing audit trails for the `enrollments` table.

**Next Immediate Step:**
- The user needs to modify the form save action for the `enrollments` table within the AppSheet editor to set the following columns:
  - `last_modified_by`: `USEREMAIL()`
  - `last_modified_time`: `NOW()`

**Upcoming Major Phase (from `TODO.md`):**
- Phase 3: Financial Management & Renewals.

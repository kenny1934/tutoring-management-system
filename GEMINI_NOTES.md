# Gemini CLI Session Notes

This file tracks the progress and objectives of our development sessions.

---

### **Session: 2025-07-26**

**Last Task Completed:**
- Implemented audit trails for the `session_log` table.
  - **Method:** Created a reusable AppSheet action named "Set Audit Columns (Session Log)" that sets `last_modified_by` and `last_modified_time`.
  - **Integration:** This reusable action was added to other actions like "Attended" and "Edit Notes".

**Current Task: COMPLETED**
- Implemented a holiday-aware, robust renewal scheduling system.
  - **Method:**
    1.  Created a `holidays` table in `init.sql`.
    2.  Updated the `Code.gs` script to skip holidays when generating sessions.
    3.  Created a `calculate_end_date` SQL function to accurately determine enrollment end dates, independent of make-up classes.
    4.  Created the `active_enrollments_needing_renewal` view using the new function.
  - **Integration:** Updated all documentation (`README.md`, `DESIGN_NOTES.md`, `TODO.md`) to reflect the new architecture.

- Build the user-facing renewal features in the AppSheet app:
  1.  Create a new view to display the data from the `active_enrollments_needing_renewal` view.
  2.  Create the "Renew Enrollment" action, which should pre-fill a new enrollment form with the student's data.

**Upcoming Major Phase (from `TODO.md`):**
- Phase 3: Financial Management & Renewals.
